I did classification using c5.0 library in r. Also utilized gmodels library using a cross table to look at results of model 1 and model 2. Model2 uses boosted with trials set to 10. I only got .580761 using it but, was mainly trying to get practical examples of data to practice on. I hope to use more methodologies and to enter current running competitions.
